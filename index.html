            As physician workloads increase and burnout rates skyrocket, there is a constant search for new ways to
            cope.
            <strong>Sophrology</strong>, a <span>stress management technique</span> popular in Europe, may help ease the
            burden.

            The definition of sophrology is, <em>“the study of consciousness in harmony.”</em> The practice was founded
            in the early 1960s by
            Colombian neuropsychiatrist and professor Caycedo as an alternative option to potentially traumatic
            interventions. Professor Caycedo sought to use sophrology to treat war veterans with posttraumatic stress
            syndrome.
            The practice was first implemented in France and Switzerland and is now even covered by health insurance.
